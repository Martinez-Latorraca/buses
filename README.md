# buses

This app was created with expo for React-Native. 

All icons were created by myself in InkScape (https://inkscape.org/es/).

Some recommendations, you can search for minibuses in Montevideo, Uruguay, from the Cutcsa company,
lines such as 103, 121, 116, 174, 181, 183 or simply click on the search button and it shows all the lines available at the time.

If you are abroad, keep in mind that your location is different from the lines, 
you can also search for a line and click on the drop-down list below and it will take you to the location of the bus line.

To search for a different line, you could reload the app with the option in expo

This was tested only on IOS, but still works on android.
